# Welcome to Explore Development Opportunities with Clique!

Clique builds identity oracles that allow users to prove arbitrary data they can access through TLS sessions with cryptographic primitives like ZKP, TEE, and MPC.  

For more information about developing with Clique SDKs, check out our [Developer Documentation] here (https://docs.clique.social/).
